- Quick monthly income/expense overview

### 2. **Transaction Tracking** 💸

### 4. **Budget Management** 📊

## Why These Features?

Following Steve Jobs' philosophy of "focus and simplicity," these four features cover the essential needs:

- **Know where you stand** (Net Worth Dashboard)
- **Track your money** (Transactions)
- **Organize your accounts** (Accounts)
- **Control your spending** (Budgets)

Everything else is noise.

2. Add your accounts
3. Start logging transactions
4. Set your budgets
